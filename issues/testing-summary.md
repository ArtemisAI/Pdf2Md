# Pdf2Md MCP Server Testing Issues Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of the HTTP-MCP server implementation has been completed. The server architecture is solid and most tools are functional, but several critical issues were identified during testing.

## Testing Results Summary

### ✅ Working Tools (5/9)
- **DOCX to Markdown**: Successfully converts Word documents
- **Audio to Markdown**: Successfully transcribes audio files
- **Webpage to Markdown**: Successfully converts web pages
- **Bing Search to Markdown**: Successfully converts search results
- **Get Markdown File**: Successfully retrieves existing Markdown files

### ❌ Tools with Issues (4/9)
- **XLSX to Markdown**: Returns webpage content instead of Excel data
- **PPTX to Markdown**: Returns webpage content instead of PowerPoint data
- **Image to Markdown**: Returns empty content
- **YouTube to Markdown**: Buffer overflow error

## Detailed Issue Reports

### 1. XLSX Tool Issue
- **File**: `issues/xlsx-tool-issue.md`
- **Problem**: Returns Microsoft Surface webpage content instead of Excel data
- **Impact**: High - Core functionality broken
- **Status**: Needs investigation of file processing logic

### 2. PPTX Tool Issue
- **File**: `issues/pptx-tool-issue.md`
- **Problem**: Returns University of North Florida webpage content instead of PowerPoint data
- **Impact**: High - Core functionality broken
- **Status**: Needs investigation of file processing logic

### 3. Image Tool Issue
- **File**: `issues/image-tool-issue.md`
- **Problem**: Returns completely empty content
- **Impact**: High - Core functionality broken
- **Status**: Needs investigation of image processing implementation

### 4. YouTube Tool Issue
- **File**: `issues/youtube-tool-issue.md`
- **Problem**: Buffer overflow error ("stdout maxBuffer length exceeded")
- **Impact**: Medium - Important but has workarounds
- **Status**: Needs buffer size increase or streaming implementation

## Common Patterns Identified

### File Processing Issues
- XLSX, PPTX, and Image tools all exhibit similar problems
- All return webpage content instead of processing actual files
- Suggests systematic issue with file path resolution or processing logic
- DOCX tool works correctly, indicating the pattern is not universal

### Web Content Tools Working
- Webpage and Bing search tools function correctly
- YouTube tool has buffer issue but attempts to process content
- Suggests web content processing is generally working

## Server Architecture Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- HTTP-streamable MCP implementation is solid
- GPU-accelerated audio transcription working (19.4x speed achieved)
- Health check endpoint functional
- MCP protocol compliance verified
- Most tools operational

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- File processing pipeline needs debugging
- Buffer size handling for large content
- Error handling and logging could be enhanced
- Test coverage for edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix file processing tools (XLSX, PPTX, Image)
2. **Secondary Priority**: Resolve YouTube buffer overflow
3. **Testing**: Expand test coverage for all tools
4. **Documentation**: Update README with known issues

## Environment Details
- **Branch**: HTTP-MCP
